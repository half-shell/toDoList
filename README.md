## CONCEPT

This application just consists of a simple to do list application which purpose is to be a CRUD, with serialization.

Design wise, it'll just contain an input text field at the bottom, with all the Todos above it. 
Todos can be edited and deleted, and be marked as TODO, or already done, so the user can get to see his progress.
All these feature will have a visual return effect so javaFX can be exploited as intended.
